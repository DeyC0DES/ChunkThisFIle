# **CHUNK THIS FILE PROJECT**

### Hey :D Im Dey Codes and this is another one of my projects, this time I made a program that can split files, folders, zips, exe, jar maybe all files that can be read in bytes into chunks.
### If you don't know how it works, here is an explanation and a tutorial of this program.

#
# How this program works?

It's simple, all computer files can be read in bytes, with this information you can read bytes from an .exe for example and store it, if you copy these bytes and create a new file with these bytes this new file will be transformed in the same file, because you are copying and pasting the same structure.

So, to divide I start by choosing a size in bytes, this value could be 1mb 2mb 100mb, whatever, and I made the program read the bytes with this limit, then the program will read the bytes until it reaches the limit, it will create part 1 , and will read again until the entire file is finished.

To rebuild the file, the program basically reads and puts all the parts together, building the structure again.

This process does not make the file lighter than it was, if this happens something is wrong.

# About the folders

In the README says to organize the folder to works correctly, on the gif below you can see what you need to do!
