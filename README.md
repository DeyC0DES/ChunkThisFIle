# **CHUNK THIS FILE PROJECT**

### Hey :D Im Dey Codes and this is another one of my projects, this time I made a program that can split files, folders, zips, exe, jar maybe all files that can be read in bytes into chunks.
### If you don't know how it works, here is an explanation and a tutorial of this program.

#
# How this program works?

It's simple, all computer files can be read in bytes, with this information you can read bytes from an .exe for example and store it, if you copy these bytes and create a new file with these bytes this new file will be transformed in the same file, because you are copying and pasting the same structure.

So, to divide I start by choosing a size in bytes, this value could be 1mb 2mb 100mb, whatever, and I made the program read the bytes with this limit, then the program will read the bytes until it reaches the limit, it will create part 1 , and will read again until the entire file is finished.

To rebuild the file, the program basically reads and puts all the parts together, building the structure again.

This process does not make the file lighter than it was, if this happens something is wrong.

# About the folders

In the README says to organize the folder to works correctly, on the prints below you can see what you need to do!

Your folder will be here and what you need do its create a new folder!

Good and with this new folder put your file that you want to divide on that, i want to divide the fnaf2 DOOM.

Now lets copy the fnaf2 folder path and run the program!

Select the option that you want, i want to divide so i will type "C" to chunk it. And now put the folder path or file whatever. After that will open a menu with some size options to divide, choose one e press enter.

# **New files created**

Look we have new files! Lets open the files folder and the chunks folder.

# **Chunks Folder**

Here its the fnaf2 DOOM parts, divided by chunks of 4mb

# **Rebuild**

To rebuild run the program again choose "R" to rebuild and put the chunks path.

# **Rebuild file**

And the file rebuilded its finished!

### ｡°⚠︎°｡ MAYBE THE PROGRAM CAN BE INDENTIFIED AS MALWARE BY ANTVIRUS BECAUSE THIT PROGRAM MANIPULES FILES, BUT ITS CLEAN AND THE CODE IS OPEN FOR MODIFICATION, JUST DONT FORGET TO MENTION ME :D ｡°⚠︎°
